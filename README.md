### 🗃️ Project Overview
Hong Kong is a famous global city and a major destination for Travellers looking for adventure, culture, and business.
People want to start a new life, work, or study. Because so many people are always looking for a place to stay, the property rental market is very active.
So I conducted a comprehensive Listings market analysis and made a proposal with recommendations for travellers and investors.
